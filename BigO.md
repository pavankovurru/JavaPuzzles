# Big O Time complexity and Space complexity

- Constant O(1)
a method that takes in an array and an index to return the value in that index.

- Linear  - O(n)
Single loop - `Linear` approach, a method that takes in an array and prints all the elements in it.  

- Quadratic - O(n square)

- Cubic - O(n cube)

- Exponential - O(n power n)


### Sorting Algorithms:

- Binary Search - O(log n Base 2)
how many times can you divide N by 2 until you have 1

- Bubble sort/Insertion sort/Selection sort - O(n square)
`Quadratic` since we use 2 loops iterating over every element.

- Merge sort - O(n log n)

- Quick sort - average: n log n, Worst case : O(n square)

worst case scenario is n square but it is better than merge sort in space complexity as it does inplace substitution and does not create new arrays like merge sort.
